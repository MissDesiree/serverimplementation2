Examine virtualization and container technologies.

Reflection 1: Creating a Virtual Network

I finished the lab on creating a virtual network in Microsoft Azure, and it was a great learning experience. I learned how to use the Azure dashboard, create and set up a virtual network, and understand the roles of different parts like resource groups, subscriptions, and deployment templates. This lab gave me a hands-on chance to see how virtual networks work in the cloud, which is important for modern IT.

I had a few questions during and after the lab about advanced network setup. I was thinking about how to set up network security groups and routing tables in the best way to make the network more secure and efficient. I also wondered about how virtual networks can grow as a company grows. As a company gets bigger, its network needs will get bigger, too. It’s important to learn how to make a virtual network bigger in a good way while keeping costs down and keeping everything working well.

In a work setting, the things I learned in this lab are really useful. For instance, if I work as an Application Clinical Analyst in a healthcare company, knowing how to create and control virtual networks can help make sure that important applications, like the ones that handle patient information, are kept safe and working well. To secure their storage account to a specific set of supported networks, they need to set up network rules. These rules will limit access to only those applications that request data from the designated networks. According to a book, Microsoft Azure Administrator, “You can secure your storage account to a specific set of supported networks. For this, you have to configure network rules so that only applications that request data over the specific set of networks can access the storage account. When these network rules are effective, the application needs to use proper authorization on the request” (Zaal, 2019, p.89). You can grant access to your storage account in a few different ways. One way is to use your Azure Active Directory credentials for blobs and queues. Another option is to use a Shared Access Signature (SAS) token or a valid account access key. These security measures help protect your storage account from unauthorized access so that only approved applications in specific networks can access or work with the stored data.

Reflection 2: Create Container Instances

I completed a lab on setting up container instances in Microsoft Azure. It was really helpful and gave me a better understanding of how to manage applications in a cloud environment using containers. The lab walked me through the process of choosing the right resources, setting up container options, and handling deployment tasks. Doing this hands-on exercise helped me learn the basics of container coordination and how it makes it easier to deploy. However, there was a problem where the task wasn’t marked as completed even though it passed the validations, so I contacted my professor to get help.

Despite the lab’s extensive resources, there are still unanswered questions. What are the best ways to manage containers, especially in environments where apps are frequently updated? How can we keep container instances secure in shared environments? It’s also important to know how to smoothly merge containers into continuous delivery systems. Lastly, what tools and methods can help monitor and improve the performance of container instances in Azure? These questions highlight the need for more exploration in advanced container management, security, merging, and performance upgrading.

In a work environment, the things I learned from this lab are very useful. For instance, if I work at a healthcare company as an Application Clinical Analyst where I can work on my team I hope soon, I can use container instances to make it easier to put applications in place that handle patient data or help with telemedicine services. Containers provide a consistent and separate environment, making sure that applications run well no matter what kind of system they’re on. Also, container instances can be used to quickly put out updates and new features, making the IT department more flexible and able to respond faster. This is important in healthcare, where having up-to-date software can directly affect patient care. By connecting container instances with continuous delivery, the deployment process can be automated, cutting down on the chance of mistakes and making sure updates happen smoothly. Containers are becoming more popular for packing, launching, and handling cloud applications because they work well and stay the same in various settings. According to an article, “Azure Container Instances offers the fastest and simplest way to run a container in Azure, without having to manage any virtual machines and without having to adopt a higher-level service” (Microsoft, 2023). With this service, you can focus on your application instead of the technical.  Azure Container Instances makes it simple and affordable to run containers in the cloud. It’s great for situations where you need temporary or occasional heavy workloads.
